    <!-- Performance -->
    <div class="category">
      <h2>üì± Performance</h2>
      <div class="sticky performance">"Pages load very slowly, even when I have good signal. It makes it frustrating to check anything quickly."</div>
      <div class="sticky performance">"There‚Äôs a noticeable delay when switching between tabs in the app."</div>
      <div class="sticky performance">"The app freezes for a few seconds every time I open it. I usually end up force closing it."</div>
      <div class="sticky performance">"Using the app on public Wi-Fi is almost impossible‚Äîit just hangs."</div>
      <div class="sticky performance">"It often takes longer to open than just going to the campus website."</div>
    </div>

    <!-- UI/UX -->
    <div class="category">
      <h2>üé® UI/UX Design</h2>
      <div class="sticky uiux">"The layout is confusing. I always forget where certain features are."</div>
      <div class="sticky uiux">"Some buttons don‚Äôt look like buttons‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs clickable."</div>
      <div class="sticky uiux">"I had to tap through several screens just to get back to the homepage. It‚Äôs not intuitive."</div>
      <div class="sticky uiux">"The schedule section feels cluttered. It‚Äôs hard to read when I‚Äôm in a rush."</div>
      <div class="sticky uiux">"There‚Äôs no clear hierarchy on most pages. Everything looks the same in size and color."</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Features -->
    <div class="category">
      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Features</h2>
      <div class="sticky features">"It would be useful to see the bus schedule directly in the app instead of being redirected to a browser."</div>
      <div class="sticky features">"The campus map is too basic‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to locate classrooms or services."</div>
      <div class="sticky features">"I wish I could see my student ID without having to go through multiple steps."</div>
      <div class="sticky features">"There‚Äôs no real customization. I only use 2 or 3 features but have to scroll through everything."</div>
      <div class="sticky features">"It‚Äôs missing practical features like reminders or push alerts for deadlines."</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Stability -->
    <div class="category">
      <h2>üß± Stability</h2>
      <div class="sticky stability">"Sometimes the app logs me out randomly, even if I just used it the day before."</div>
      <div class="sticky stability">"It crashed when I was trying to look up my course list. I had to restart it twice."</div>
      <div class="sticky stability">"There were multiple times I couldn‚Äôt log in because of a server error."</div>
      <div class="sticky stability">"The app becomes unresponsive if I switch to another app and return."</div>
      <div class="sticky stability">"Updates seem to break more things than they fix. After the last update, I couldn‚Äôt access my ID."</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Usefulness -->
    <div class="category">
      <h2>üí° Usefulness</h2>
      <div class="sticky usefulness">"The app has potential, but I only use it for one or two things because the rest is hard to navigate."</div>
      <div class="sticky usefulness">"It doesn't really add much beyond what I can already get from the website."</div>
      <div class="sticky usefulness">"It took me weeks to realize it even had an event calendar. Nothing highlights the features well."</div>
      <div class="sticky usefulness">"I downloaded it during orientation but stopped using it soon after."</div>
      <div class="sticky usefulness">"Most of my classmates don‚Äôt even know the app exists. It doesn‚Äôt feel essential."</div>

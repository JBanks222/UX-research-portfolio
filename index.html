  <section id="usability-testing">
    <h3>🧪 Usability Testing</h3>
    <p>We tested clickable prototypes with real QCC students and staff.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tested with 15 participants</li>
      <li>Captured usability metrics (task time, error rate, satisfaction)</li>
      <li>Insights: users preferred simple layout, disliked loading times</li>
    </ul>
    <p>💡 Result: Simplified the schedule view and added a loading indicator.</p>

  <section id="design-ideation">
    <h3>🧠 Design Ideation</h3>
    <p>After identifying pain points, we brainstormed several features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-contrast redesign to support dark mode</li>
      <li>Modular card system for dynamic scheduling</li>
      <li>“Quick Access” dashboard idea to cut down tap-throughs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Paper Sketches</p>
  </section>

  <section id="wireframes">
    <h3>📐 Prototyping & Wireframes</h3>
    <p>We built low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to explore flow and layout:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used Figma for collaborative prototyping</li>
      <li>Tested swipe, button, and tab patterns</li>
      <li>Incorporated microinteractions and loading states</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="research">
    <h3>🔍 Discovery & Research</h3>
    <p>Understanding the needs of the QCC community was the foundation of this project. I organized a full-scale research initiative to gather diverse perspectives:</p>
  
    <h4>Recruitment Strategy</h4>
    <p>Recognizing the importance of broad representation, I proactively recruited classmates across different majors — including Nursing, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Business — ensuring we captured a wide range of user needs and behaviors.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>📚 Personally invited 30+ classmates across multiple disciplines to participate in surveys and interviews</li>
      <li>📄 Designed and posted over 50 flyers across campus (library, cafeteria, student union, computer labs)</li>
      <li>🎯 Flyers included QR codes leading directly to screener surveys to streamline recruitment</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Collaboration with Marketing Department</h4>
    <p>To scale up the reach, I partnered with the QCC Marketing Department. Working together, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎥 Created short promotional slides featuring a QR code linking to the screener surveys</li>
      <li>📺 Displayed the QR code on digital signage screens across the campus (e.g., student center, lobbies, cafeterias)</li>
      <li>📈 Increased survey participation by 70% within the first week of promotion</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Research Methods</h4>
    <p>Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we gathered insights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 110 survey responses collected within two weeks</li>
      <li>🎙️ 15 structured user interviews (average 20 minutes each)</li>
      <li>🖥️ 10 usability testing sessions using mid-fidelity prototypes</li>
      <li>🔎 Analyzed app store reviews for supplemental insights into user frustrations</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>🎯 <strong>Key Problem Identified:</strong> "I can't find my classes easily or know when the bus is coming."</p>
    <p>💬 <strong>Secondary Insights:</strong> Students wanted faster access to schedules, campus navigation, and real-time transit updates — all in a simple, reliable app experience.</p>
